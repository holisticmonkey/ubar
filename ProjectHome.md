Ubar is yet another in a long line of [PHP MVC frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#PHP). It was created primarily in response to a series of perceived failings in existing
PHP frameworks. Specifically, the coupling of urls to specific php files rather than using a dispatcher, poor internationalization support, and a focus on
templates rather than actions or components. For those of you familiar with Struts and Tiles, these concepts and implementations may be
familiar to you. Please note however that this project is in no way meant to be a port of Struts and Tiles to PHP.

The project is developed and maintained in its entirety by myself, Joshua Ganderson. There are no plans for it to tie into any revenue
stream and I am not available for contracting work or paid feature requests. However, I do welcome feedback and will try to be
responsive to bug reports. While all feature requests will be considered, this is an intentionally bare-bones framework. Unless the feature
is something I expect most developers will use, I will leave it out.
